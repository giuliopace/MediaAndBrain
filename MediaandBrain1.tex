\section{Adaptation and Learning in the psychological literature}

	In this chapter we will focus on comparing different definitions of the terms “learning” and “adaptation” within existing literature and papers in the psychological science field. The goal is to create an overview of possible definitions by looking at similarities as well as differences.

	At first, we will take a look at the term “adaptation”. In their publication “Evaluating Evidence of Psychological Adaptation: How Do We Know One When We See One?” [1], David P. Schmitt and June J. Pilcher refer to adaptation as both, a verb and a noun:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Adaptation as a verb defines the process of evolution, where an animal (human or non-human) will change either on an individual basis or over the lifespan of its species to overcome challenges in its environment and become better suited to survive in the given environment;
		\item Adaptation as a noun defines the outcome or product of evolution, where they further narrow it down to two basic forms. On the one side, adaptation might be seen as a characteristic feature of an animal in order to survive or reproduce in its given environment, on the other hand, it can also be defined as the “historical end products of the process of evolution”.
	\end{itemize}

	The term “learning” can be seen similarly to the term “adaptation”. G. Hall defines the act of learning in [2] as the process by which a creature “interacts with its environment and becomes changed by this experience so that its subsequent behaviour is modified”. In [3], learning is also described as a process of gaining new characteristic features based on study or experience. Linking the process of adapting to changes and learning based on experience, Robert A. Rescorla defines the term “learning” in [4] as “a process by which an organism benefits from experience so that its future behaviour is better adapted to its environment”.

	Another way of looking at the process of learning in a psychology is to describe it as a change in a creature’s behaviour, similarly to what adaptation as a noun can be seen as. Jan De Houwer describes learning as a set of changes in a creature’s behaviour resulting from patterns in its environment [5], resulting from his observations from two other definitions, functionally as “changes in behavior that result from experience” and mechanistically as “changes in the organism that result from experience”.

	In [6], the definition of the term “learning” is also seen as problematic, as it differs within and across disciplines of research. The conducted study reviewed several scientific papers and publications and concluded in a set of classes: (1) learning defined as the processing of information or experience, (2) learning defined as behavioural change and (3) learning defined as changes in behavioural mechanisms.

\section{Adaptation and Learning in neurology}
	We refer at ``learning'' as the process of acquiring new knowledge or modifying the existing one. Knowledge can not only be about notions but also behaviors, skills, value or preferences.[7]
	``Memory'' is what allow us to store and retrieve the knowledge we gather through the learning process.
	In neurology it is hard to talk about learning without talking about memory and viceversa. In this chapter we will focus on the different kinds of memory and the brain areas responsible for them.
	Since memory and learning are two really interconnected processes, the same areas of the brain that are used to learn new information are the same that are activated when retrieving the same information.

	\subsection{Memory distinction}\label{AA}
		Memory is a general word used for both Short Term Memory and Long Term Memory. We are now going to focus on the latter, because is where we find the mechanism of adaptation overall of learning.
		We distinguish the Long Term Memory in two categories: ``Explicit Memory'' and ``Implicit Memory''.
		The first kind, also referred as ``Declarative memory'',  stores information about facts, things, people and places. In order for the piece of information to be retrieved, we are required an effort.
		The Explicit Memory is further differentiated in two sub-categories: ``Semantic Memory'', that is about general knowledge of facts about the world around us, and Episodic Memory, in charge of storing information regarding a specific time and space.
		For example, the concept of bicycle is delegated to the Semantic Memory, while the Episodic Memory will take care of remembering episodes related to bicycles.
		The Implicit Memory, also called ``Nondeclarative Memory'', is about learning physical acts or other skills that are recalled automatically and without an active thought towards it.
		It is divided in ``Priming'', ``Procedural Memory'', ``Associative Memory'' and ``Non-Associative Memory''.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Priming is the influence that a stimulus has on subsequent stimuli;
			\item Procedural Memory is the kind of memory used to learn how to perform specific tasks without thinking. Going back to the bicycle example, this kind of memory ensures that, once learned how to ride a bike, we will be able to ride it without thinking;
			\item The Associative Memory regards the creation of a relation between two or more stimuli or between a stimulus and an associated behavior, as proved by the experiments conducted by Pavlov and Skinner;
			\item The Non-Associative Memory manages the learning of the properties of a specific stimulus. There are two opposite kinds of non-associative learning: Habituation and sensitization:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Habituation is defined as a decrease in response to a stimulus repeated in time. The stimulus is marked as ``not harmful'' or ``not useful'' so the subject will start to ignore it.
				\item Sensitization is the opposite phenomenon: after an intense or a noxious stimulus, the subject will overreact to similar stimuli in order to protect itself.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Adaptation}\label{AA}
		Adaptation is a similar concept to Habituation, but if the latter occurs with stimuli that occur periodically, the first is observed when there is a constant and continuous stimulus.
		On the physical level, mammals and other living organisms are constantly monitoring their environment through receptor cells that allow them to receive and process the stimuli. Through a ion flow, positive or negative feedback are sent to the receptors to allow the cells to close or open channel according to the ion flow. [8]
		It is believed that adaptation could modify the response range of the neurons in order to encode the signals to a more suitable strength. [9]
